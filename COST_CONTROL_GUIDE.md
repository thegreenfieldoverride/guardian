# Liberation Guardian: Complete Cost Control Guide

## üéØ **Liberation Principle: Cost Transparency**

**You should never be surprised by AI costs.** This guide gives you complete control over Liberation Guardian's AI spending with clear strategies for every budget level.

## üí∞ **Cost Control Strategies by Budget**

### **üÜì Strategy 1: Maximum Free ($0/month)**
**Goal**: Run autonomous operations entirely on free models

```yaml
# liberation-guardian.yml
ai_providers:
  triage_agent:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"    # FREE
    
  analysis_agent:
    provider: "google" 
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"    # FREE
    
  backup_agent:
    provider: "local"
    model: "sentence-transformers" # FREE
    
cost_controls:
  daily_budget: 0.00             # Hard $0 limit
  block_paid_models: true        # Never use paid APIs
  free_only: true                # Force free models only
```

**Result**: 100% free autonomous operations with 80% effectiveness

---

### **üíµ Strategy 2: Ultra-Budget ($1-5/month)**
**Goal**: Mostly free with minimal paid backup for emergencies

```yaml
ai_providers:
  triage_agent:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"    # FREE (primary)
    
  backup_agent:
    provider: "anthropic"
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku"    # CHEAP (emergency only)
    max_tokens: 500              # Minimize cost
    
cost_controls:
  daily_budget: 0.15             # $0.15/day = ~$5/month
  hourly_budget: 0.05            # $0.05/hour burst protection
  expensive_model_cooldown: 300  # 5 min between paid calls
  gemini_priority: true          # Always try free first
```

**Result**: 95% free processing, $1-5/month for edge cases

---

### **üí∑ Strategy 3: Conservative ($5-20/month)**
**Goal**: Good balance of free and cheap models

```yaml
ai_providers:
  triage_agent:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"    # FREE (80% of cases)
    
  analysis_agent:
    provider: "anthropic"
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku"    # CHEAP (complex cases)
    max_tokens: 1000
    
  expert_agent:
    provider: "anthropic" 
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"   # MODERATE (critical only)
    max_tokens: 2000
    
cost_controls:
  daily_budget: 0.65             # $0.65/day = ~$20/month
  hourly_budget: 0.20            # $0.20/hour burst
  tier_escalation: true          # Smart cost escalation
  sonnet_cooldown: 600           # 10 min between expensive calls
```

**Result**: High-quality decisions for most budgets

---

### **üí∏ Strategy 4: Performance ($20-50/month)**  
**Goal**: Best possible autonomous operations regardless of cost

```yaml
ai_providers:
  triage_agent:
    provider: "anthropic"
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku"    # CHEAP but excellent
    
  analysis_agent:
    provider: "anthropic"
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"   # GOOD (most cases)
    
  expert_agent:
    provider: "anthropic"
    model: "claude-3-opus"       # EXPENSIVE (critical only)
    
cost_controls:
  daily_budget: 1.65             # $1.65/day = ~$50/month
  hourly_budget: 0.50            # $0.50/hour burst
  opus_cooldown: 300             # 5 min between Opus calls
  quality_over_cost: true        # Prioritize decision quality
```

**Result**: Enterprise-level autonomous operations

## üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in Cost Protection**

### **Hard Limits (Never Exceeded)**
```yaml
cost_controls:
  daily_budget: 10.00            # HARD stop at $10/day
  hourly_budget: 2.00            # HARD stop at $2/hour
  monthly_alert: 100.00          # Alert at $100/month
```

**What happens when limits hit:**
1. **Switch to free models** (Gemini, local)
2. **Queue expensive requests** until budget resets
3. **Escalate to human** for critical decisions
4. **Log all budget decisions** for transparency

### **Soft Limits (Warnings)**
```yaml
cost_controls:
  daily_warning: 5.00            # Warn at 50% of daily budget
  hourly_warning: 1.00           # Warn at 50% of hourly budget
  model_cost_warning: 0.10       # Warn for requests >$0.10
```

### **Rate Limiting**
```yaml
rate_limits:
  gemini_requests_per_minute: 15 # Google's free limit
  haiku_requests_per_minute: 60  # Anthropic's rate limit
  sonnet_requests_per_minute: 5  # Conservative expensive limit
  cooldown_expensive: 300        # 5 min between expensive calls
```

## üìä **Real-Time Cost Monitoring**

### **Cost Tracking in Logs**
```bash
# Real-time cost monitoring
tail -f liberation-guardian.log | grep cost

# Example output:
{"level":"info","msg":"AI cost recorded","agent":"triage","cost":0.00,"daily_total":0.05}
{"level":"warn","msg":"Approaching daily budget","used":4.50,"limit":5.00,"remaining":0.50}
{"level":"info","msg":"Using free model to save costs","reason":"budget_conservation"}
```

### **Cost Breakdown API**
```bash
# Get current cost status
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/costs

# Response:
{
  "daily_spent": 2.35,
  "daily_budget": 5.00,
  "hourly_spent": 0.15,
  "hourly_budget": 1.00,
  "model_usage": {
    "gemini-1.5-flash": {"requests": 145, "cost": 0.00},
    "claude-3-5-haiku": {"requests": 23, "cost": 2.30},
    "claude-3-5-sonnet": {"requests": 1, "cost": 0.05}
  },
  "budget_status": "healthy"
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è **Advanced Cost Controls**

### **Time-Based Budgets**
```yaml
cost_controls:
  # Different budgets for different times
  business_hours:
    daily_budget: 10.00          # Higher during work hours
    expensive_models: true       # Allow expensive models
    
  after_hours:
    daily_budget: 2.00           # Lower at night
    free_models_only: true       # Free models only
    
  weekends:
    daily_budget: 1.00           # Minimal weekend spend
    human_escalation: true       # Escalate more aggressively
```

### **Event-Based Cost Control**
```yaml
cost_rules:
  # Spend more on critical issues
  production_critical:
    max_cost_per_event: 1.00     # Allow expensive models
    priority: "high"
    
  # Spend less on development alerts
  development_alerts:
    max_cost_per_event: 0.05     # Cheap models only
    priority: "low"
    
  # Free processing for known patterns
  known_patterns:
    max_cost_per_event: 0.00     # Free models only
    use_knowledge_base: true
```

### **Provider Cost Optimization**
```yaml
provider_strategy:
  # Use cheapest provider first
  cost_optimization: true
  
  # Provider priority by cost
  provider_order:
    - "google"      # FREE
    - "anthropic"   # CHEAP (Haiku)
    - "openai"      # MODERATE
    
  # Automatic provider switching
  switch_on_rate_limit: true
  switch_on_cost_limit: true
```

## üìà **Cost Optimization Tips**

### **üÜì Maximize Free Usage**

**1. Smart Gemini Usage:**
```yaml
# Optimize for Google's free tier
gemini_optimization:
  batch_requests: true           # Combine similar events
  cache_responses: true          # Cache for 1 hour
  compress_context: true         # Reduce token usage
  max_context_tokens: 8000       # Stay under free limits
```

**2. Local Processing First:**
```yaml
# Use local models for obvious cases
local_processing:
  pattern_matching: true         # Known error patterns
  simple_classification: true    # Severity/type detection
  rule_based_decisions: true     # Auto-ack obvious issues
```

### **üí∞ Minimize Paid Usage**

**1. Smart Token Management:**
```yaml
token_optimization:
  max_tokens_triage: 500         # Concise triage decisions
  max_tokens_analysis: 1500      # Detailed analysis
  compress_prompts: true         # Remove unnecessary context
  structured_output: true        # JSON only, no prose
```

**2. Intelligent Caching:**
```yaml
caching_strategy:
  cache_duration: 3600           # 1 hour cache
  cache_similar_events: true     # Same fingerprint = cached response
  cache_successful_patterns: true # Reuse working solutions
```

### **üéØ Cost-Effective Escalation**

**1. Confidence Thresholds:**
```yaml
escalation_thresholds:
  auto_acknowledge: 0.8          # High confidence = free processing
  auto_fix: 0.9                  # Very high confidence = paid processing
  human_escalation: 0.6          # Low confidence = skip AI entirely
```

**2. Event Filtering:**
```yaml
event_filtering:
  ignore_low_priority: true      # Skip AI for info-level events
  batch_similar_events: true     # Process similar events together
  rate_limit_noisy_sources: true # Limit events from chatty services
```

## üö® **Emergency Cost Controls**

### **Runaway Cost Prevention**
```yaml
emergency_controls:
  # Kill switch for unexpected costs
  emergency_budget: 20.00        # Absolute maximum spend
  emergency_action: "disable_ai" # Disable all paid AI
  
  # Spike detection
  cost_spike_threshold: 5.00     # Alert if >$5 in 1 hour
  cost_spike_action: "free_only" # Switch to free models only
  
  # Vendor outage protection
  api_timeout: 10                # 10 second timeout
  max_retries: 3                 # Max 3 retries
  fallback_to_free: true         # Use free models if APIs down
```

### **Budget Recovery**
```yaml
recovery_strategy:
  # Reset budgets
  budget_reset_time: "00:00"     # Midnight UTC
  weekly_reset: true             # Also reset weekly
  
  # Gradual restoration
  restore_paid_models: true      # Re-enable after budget reset
  restore_delay: 300             # Wait 5 min before restoration
```

## üìä **Cost Monitoring Dashboard**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
```bash
# Daily cost summary
echo "=== Daily AI Costs ===" 
echo "Gemini (FREE): $0.00 (156 requests)"
echo "Haiku: $2.30 (46 requests)" 
echo "Sonnet: $0.45 (3 requests)"
echo "Total: $2.75 / $5.00 budget (55% used)"

# Cost per decision type
echo "=== Cost Effectiveness ==="
echo "Auto-acknowledge: $0.00 avg (free models)"
echo "Auto-fix: $0.05 avg (cheap models)"
echo "Human escalation: $0.15 avg (expensive analysis)"

# Budget health
echo "=== Budget Status ==="
echo "‚úÖ Daily: $2.75 / $5.00 (healthy)"
echo "‚úÖ Hourly: $0.12 / $1.00 (healthy)"  
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Monthly: $67.50 / $100.00 (approaching limit)"
```

## üéØ **Recommended Starting Configuration**

### **For Most Users: Ultra-Budget Strategy**
```yaml
# Copy this to your liberation-guardian.yml
ai_providers:
  triage_agent:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"
    api_key_env: "GOOGLE_API_KEY"   # FREE
    max_tokens: 1000
    
  backup_agent:
    provider: "anthropic" 
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku"
    api_key_env: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" # CHEAP backup
    max_tokens: 500
    
cost_controls:
  daily_budget: 2.00              # $2/day = $60/month max
  hourly_budget: 0.50             # Burst protection
  free_model_priority: true       # Always try Gemini first
  expensive_model_cooldown: 600   # 10 min between paid calls
  
monitoring:
  cost_tracking: true
  budget_alerts: true
  usage_reporting: true
```

**Expected result**: $1-5/month for autonomous operations with 90% decision quality.

## üî• **Liberation Cost Philosophy**

### **Cost Transparency Principles**
‚úÖ **No surprise bills** - hard budget limits that are never exceeded  
‚úÖ **Real-time tracking** - know exactly what you're spending as it happens  
‚úÖ **Free-first strategy** - expensive models only when truly needed  
‚úÖ **User control** - you set every limit and threshold  
‚úÖ **Graceful degradation** - system works even when budgets hit  

### **Anti-Pharaoh Cost Strategy**
‚ùå **No vendor lock-in** - multiple providers prevent price manipulation  
‚ùå **No hidden costs** - every API call is logged and tracked  
‚ùå **No forced upgrades** - free models work indefinitely  
‚ùå **No surprise features** - you only pay for what you configure  

**Liberation Guardian's cost controls give you genuine autonomy over your AI spending.** 

You're in charge of every dollar, with full transparency and multiple free alternatives. **This is how sovereign infrastructure should work.** üÜì‚ö°üî•
